### Blog Post: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

---

#### Introduction

When you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events takes place behind the scenes to bring Google's homepage to your screen. This process involves multiple components of the web stack working together seamlessly. In this post, we'll break down each step, from DNS resolution to rendering the web page.

#### DNS Request

The first step in this journey is the DNS (Domain Name System) request. DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. When you enter `www.google.com`, your browser needs to find the corresponding IP address to communicate with Google's servers.

1. **Browser Cache**: The browser first checks its cache to see if it has recently resolved `www.google.com` and has the IP address stored.
2. **Operating System Cache**: If the browser cache doesn't have it, the OS cache is checked next.
3. **Router Cache**: The request then moves to your router, which may have cached the IP address.
4. **ISP DNS Server**: If none of the above caches have the IP address, the request is sent to your ISP's DNS server.
5. **Recursive DNS Servers**: These servers will query other DNS servers on the internet to resolve the domain name if needed.
6. **Authoritative DNS Server**: Eventually, the request reaches Google's authoritative DNS server, which provides the IP address for `www.google.com`.

Once the IP address is found, it is sent back through the same path to your browser.

#### TCP/IP

With the IP address in hand, your browser establishes a connection with Google's server using the TCP/IP protocol suite.

1. **TCP Handshake**: A three-step handshake process is initiated:
   - **SYN**: Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate the connection.
   - **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet to acknowledge receipt.
   - **ACK**: Finally, your browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet, establishing the connection.
   
2. **IP Protocol**: This protocol is responsible for routing the packets of data between your browser and Google's server across the internet.

#### Firewall

Firewalls are security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. During the connection process, the traffic must pass through firewalls at various points, including:

1. **Local Firewall**: On your computer or local network.
2. **ISP Firewall**: At your internet service provider.
3. **Google's Firewall**: Protecting Google's network infrastructure.

These firewalls ensure that the traffic is legitimate and not malicious.

#### HTTPS/SSL

To secure the data being transmitted, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is used, which relies on SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).

1. **SSL Handshake**: During this handshake:
   - Your browser requests a secure connection.
   - Google's server responds with a certificate containing its public key.
   - Your browser verifies the certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
   - If valid, a symmetric session key is generated and encrypted with the server's public key.
   - The server decrypts this key with its private key, and both parties now share a secret session key.
   
2. **Data Encryption**: All data sent between your browser and the server is encrypted using this session key, ensuring privacy and integrity.

#### Load Balancer

Once the connection is secure, the request is handled by a load balancer. Google's load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

1. **Traffic Distribution**: The load balancer checks the server load and directs your request to the least busy server.
2. **Health Checks**: It also performs regular health checks to ensure servers are functioning properly and removes any unresponsive servers from the pool.

---

#### Web Server

The load balancer forwards the request to a web server. This server's role is to process the request and serve the requested web page.

1. **Request Handling**: The web server receives the request for `https://www.google.com` and determines which resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are needed.
2. **Response Generation**: It generates a response containing the HTML content of Google's homepage.

---

#### Application Server

Often, the web server interacts with an application server to generate dynamic content.

1. **Business Logic**: The application server executes business logic, processes user data, and handles other backend services.
2. **Data Aggregation**: It may aggregate data from various sources and perform necessary computations.

---

#### Database

To fetch the required data, the application server queries a database.

1. **Database Query**: The application server sends SQL queries to the database to retrieve information.
2. **Data Retrieval**: The database processes these queries and returns the requested data.
3. **Data Integration**: The application server integrates this data into the response being generated for the client.

---

#### Conclusion

Finally, the response is sent back through the web stack: from the application server to the web server, through the load balancer, and back to your browser. Your browser then renders the HTML content, resulting in the Google homepage appearing on your screen. 

This entire process happens in a matter of milliseconds, showcasing the efficiency and complexity of the modern web infrastructure.

### Next Steps

1. **Publish the Blog Post**: Choose a platform (Medium or LinkedIn) and publish your detailed blog post.
2. **Share the URL**: Once published, share the URL of your blog post in your project repository as required.

By understanding this process, you gain a deeper appreciation of the various technologies and protocols that work together to deliver a seamless browsing experience. This knowledge is not only crucial for interviews but also forms the foundation of your skills as a full-stack software engineer.
